#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. The data inluded 50 of the most listened to songs of 2021.
#I then created a table for the data to be imported into.

#With the table created I inserted the Spotify Data from the .csv into the table

#I then quickly checked that the data had imported correctly and that there were no issues weith the columns

#Once I had confirmed the table and data was set up correctly I decided to check out the average popularity, danceability and energy for each artist on the list
#I knew that even with only 50 songs on the list there likely would still be several artists with multiple songs on the list.
